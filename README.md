# Vintage Story Helper

This app's purpose is to be a resource for the game Vintage Story by providing a tool to plan and prepare resources such as bits into ingots for bismuth bronze, tin bronze, etc. as well as ingots for many different ingame recipes.

More to be added later.

Notes:

11/17 - Set up project on github. Removed unncessary code from app.css, app.tsx, index.css to create blank slate for app creation.

Next thing to set up is 3 separate rows: metal bits ratios, ingot amounts, total bits needed for ingots

Once set up, can add sliders to metal bits ratios, slider or number box for amount of ingots wanted, and final table or present amount of total bits required.
